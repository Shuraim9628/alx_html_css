	<p> "Who, when disaster strikes them, say, "Indeed we belong to Allah , and indeed to Him we will return.". [Qur’an 2: 156] At first glance, that sounds a little intimidating—how could every single thing belong to God? The other way to look at it is that everything belongs to you! And while you may not be able to control every situation in your life, you can take comfort in knowing that what happens is part of God’s plan  </p>
	<p> “There is no relationship between Allah and anyone except through obedience to Him.” [Umar Ibn Al Khattab </p>
